# Sleep-Spirals: Visualization of human circadian rhythms generated from accelerometry data

## Background
Circadian rhythms are patterns in behaviour and physiology that recur on a 24 hour time period, such as the sleep-wake cycle and daily changes in body temperature. These rhythms are not simply a response to environmental changes, but are driven by endogenous timing mechanisms present in every mammalian cell [1]. Circadian clocks are disrupted when time cues such as light exposure and food intake are not synchronised with innate 24h rhythms. Studies in adults have associated circadian disruption with insulin insensitivity, weight gain and obesity [2], and there is some evidence for similar relations in children [3-5]. In addition, childhood obesity is widely associated with disrupted sleep [6], and increased evening time activity [4]. Disrupted sleep in children with obesity appears to be independent of sleep duration [7,8], which is a strong indicator of underlying circadian mechanisms. Studies of circadian rhythms in children with obesity are limited by the difficulties of applying longitudinal 24h sampling protocols, as well as uncertainly about how interventions might be implemented. Advances in wrist-worn sensor technology and data analytics allow physical activity, sleep and circadian rhythms to be monitored unobtrusively over long time periods. This tecchnology has multiple potential applications in the treatment of obesity, since reduced physical activity, sleep disruption and disrupted circadian rhythms are all components of both the pathogenesis and morbidity of this condition. Visualization of the patterns and levels of daily physical activity over long time periods can be used to inform children with
obesity about circadian rhythms and to provide them with tangible evidence of the effect of interventions. 

##  Objectives
To describe a novel data visualization for communicating longitudinal rhythms in physical activity to children and their parents.

##  Methods
Following ethical approval daily physical activity was monitored in 29 children presenting for treatment of obesity at a tertiary clinic (Table 1). Data were acquired using a triaxial accelerometer (Geneactiv, UK) that the children wore on the wrist for 7 days. Daily locomotor activity was visualized by plotting a spiral polar bar chart, with the magnitude of acceleration indicated by a colour heatmap (Figure 1). For comparison, each dataset was also plotted using conventional methods for visualizing daily locomotor activity data, actigrams and line plots. Actigrams show activity levels on the y-axis and time of day on the x-axis, with each day represented by a single line of data. Line plots show absolute activity levels (x-axis) against days (y-axis) over one week. The data from each individual were plotted using all three methods for visual comparison of variations in circadian rhythms over the 7 days of recording. The open access software, R was used for all analysis.
